  Here you can find a portfolio of the projects that I created during the PLTW training.
      <br>
      <br>
      My <b>first project</b> was to make create this website from html.
      <br>
      <br>
      For my <b>second project</b>, I created a project in the online program <b>Scratch</b>.  My partner and I made a visual video to represent the story in the Pearl Jam song, "Last Kiss."  The song is a trageic love song.
      <br>
      <br>
      For my <b>third project</b>, my partner and I created an android application (an App), and our App was a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.  We used the online program <b>App Inventor</b> for this project.  This was a very challening task for us and our final product still have some glitches.  However, we had internet issues that made programming and checking it very difficult.
      <br>
      <br>
      My <b>fourth project</b> was to make create an interactive fiction story (aka choose-your-own-adventure story) using <b>Python</b>.  This was our first interaction with Python and it was a great project for getting started.  I really enjoyed my teacher's story - insert link.
